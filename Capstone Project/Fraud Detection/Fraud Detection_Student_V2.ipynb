The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.\n","\n","In a multi-layered perceptron (MLP), perceptrons are arranged in interconnected layers. The input layer collects input patterns. The output layer has classifications or output signals to which input patterns may map. \n","\n","Hidden layers fine-tune the input weightings until the neural network’s margin of error is minimal. It is hypothesized that hidden layers extrapolate salient features in the input data that have predictive power regarding the outputs.\n","\n","You will discover **[how to create](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-our-first-neural-network-in-keras-bdc8abbc17f5)** your deep learning neural network model in Python using **[Keras](https://keras.io/about/)**.
